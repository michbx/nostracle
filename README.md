# nostracle - nostr based oracle

Oracles are critical for many smart contract applications, including DLC - Distributed Log Contracts. 

IP based oracles are vulnerable, as servers can be blocked or spoofed, leaving smart contracts vulnerable. 

nostr enables a way to establish permissionless oracles.  It is sufficient they publish the price pair in their description and publish their price estimate with an appropriate frequency.
Services using such nostracle, can zap the nostracle to incentivise the nostracle and give credibility to such nostracle.
